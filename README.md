lstfiracode
===========

The `lstfiracode` package defines `FiraCodeStyle`, to be used as
`\lstset{style=FiraCodeStyle}` with the [`listings`](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings)
package. This style contains almost all ligatures in Nikita Prokopovâ€™s
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) family of fonts.
Additional support for code listings in the `verbatim` environment is also available.
