lstfiracode
===========

The `lstfiracode` package defines `FiraCodeStyle`, to be used as
`\lstset{style=FiraCodeStyle}` with the [`listings`](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings)
package. This style contains almost all ligatures in Nikita Prokopovâ€™s
[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) family of fonts.
A new key `moreliterate` to `\lstset` is added, allowing additional user ligatures.
Additional support for source code listings using Fira Code
in the `verbatim` environment is available.

This package does NOT provide the Fira Code font files.
The newest version of the font files can be downloaded at the
[GitHub Fira Code Releases page](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases).
Here is a sample preamble of a document:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{fontspec}
    \setmonofont{FiraCode-Regular.otf}[Contextuals=Alternate]
    \usepackage{listings}
    \usepackage[verbatim]{lstfiracode}
    \lstset{style=FiraCodeStyle,basicstyle=\ttfamily}
